## 🚧 Challenges & Learnings
-GitHub Pages Deployment: Encountered 404 errors due to incorrect asset paths. Resolved by setting the homepage field in package.json and adjusting the base path in vite.config.js.

-Routing Issues: Faced problems with React Router on GitHub Pages. Mitigated by using HashRouter instead of BrowserRouter to handle client-side routing more effectively.

-React 19 Compatibility: Some packages were not yet fully compatible with React 19. Resolved by testing locally and updating dependencies.
